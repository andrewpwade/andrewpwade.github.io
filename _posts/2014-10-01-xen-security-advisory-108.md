================

Today the embargo was lifted on Xen Security Advisory 108 (CVE-2014-7188). The full list of advisories can be seen at [here](http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/).

I could not help but be reminded of Theo de Raadt's eloquent of x86 virtualisation from 2006:

> x86 virtualization is about basically placing another nearly full
> kernel, full of new bugs, on top of a nasty x86 architecture which
> barely has correct page protection.  Then running your operating
> system on the other side of this brand new pile of s***.

> You are absolutely deluded, if not stupid, if you think that a
> worldwide collection of software engineers who can't write operating
> systems or applications without security holes, can then turn around
> and suddenly write virtualization layers without security holes.
