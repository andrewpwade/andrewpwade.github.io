I met my Italian house mate for the first time yesterday. When he told me he is a barrister in Italy, I was taken aback. To transfer his skills he would have to pay approximately Â£10,000 for training and examinations in England.

I had forgotten how lucky I am to have skills that can be employed from almost anywhere without needing a licence to practise.
